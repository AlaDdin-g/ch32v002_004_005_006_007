EN | [中文](README_zh.md)



### Overview
CH32V002_004_005_006_007 series chips include CH32V002, CH32V004, CH32V005, CH32V006, CH32V007, and CH32M007, which are industrial-grade general-purpose microcontrollers based on the Barley RISC-V2C core design, supporting 48MHz system main frequency, with wide voltage low power consumption, single and dual-wire debugging and other features. CH32V006, for example, it is built-in a 12-bit analog-to-digital ADC, sampling rate up to 3Msps; built-in OPA op-amps, support for high-speed mode to improve the pressure swing rate, and its P-support for 3-channel polling; provides a 7-channel DMA controller, 8-channel TouchKey, a number of groups of timers, 2 groups of USART serial port, I2C, SPI and other peripherals rich resources.
